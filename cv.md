## About Me:

My life has always been connected with computers. I recently decided to learn frontend. My ability to learn will help me pass this course.

## Skills:

* HTML5, CSS3, SCSS
* JavaScript, React basics
* Git
* Adobe Photoshop, Figma

## Code example:
>**Calculating with Functions KATA from CodeWars:** *This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the
results. Let's have a look at some examples:*
>```
>seven(times(five())); // must return 35
>four(plus(nine())); // must return 13
>eight(minus(three())); // must return 5
>six(dividedBy(two())); // must return 3
>```
>*Requirements:*
>* *There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")*
>* *There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy*
>* *Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers*
>* *The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand*
>* *Division should be integer division. For example, this should return 2, not 2.666666...:*
>```
>eight(dividedBy(three()));
>```

```
const zero = b => b ? b(0) : 0
const one = b => b ? b(1) : 1
const two = b => b ? b(2) : 2
const three = b => b ? b(3) : 3
const four = b => b ? b(4) : 4
const five = b => b ? b(5) : 5
const six = b => b ? b(6) : 6
const seven = b => b ? b(7) : 7
const eight = b => b ? b(8) : 8
const nine = b => b ? b(9) : 9
const plus = a => b => b + a
const minus = a => b => b - a
const times = a => b => b * a
const dividedBy = a => b => Math.floor(b / a)
```
